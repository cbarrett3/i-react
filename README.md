### **<i>i</i>** is a generic social network web client
Built with React and Apollo, and it provides features like posting, commenting, liking, and timeline scrolling. It consumes data via GraphQL for efficient data requests, as an alternative to REST.

The idea with <i>i</i> was to continue learning technologies such as prisma, graphql-yoga, apollo, and react through buildilng this web app. This can be forked and utilized for pretty much any social networking concept because the features implemented are generic.
